description: This post explores the process of creating a custom FlDotPainter in Flutter to match a specific design requirement, demonstrating the flexibility of Flutter's widget system, and an interactive embedded example of the custom Painter.

## Introduction
I work at a startup, where rapid prototyping is part of my daily routine. Thanks to Flutter's rich set of widgets and the vast selection of third-party packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/), I can turn around new feature prototypes in just a few hours. Here's the latest challenge I faced: a component mockup that needed a custom touch. ![Component Mockup](image)

## Problem
The [fl_chart package](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart) offers a LineChart widget that seemed ideal for our needs. However, it only includes these FlDotPainters by default:

1. FlDotCirclePainter
2. FlDotDiamondPainter
3. FlDotRectanglePainter

![FlDotCirclePainter Example](circle_painter_image)
![FlDotDiamondPainter Example](diamond_painter_image)
![FlDotRectanglePainter Example](rectangle_painter_image)

None of these matched the design I was given, and my attempts to customize them fell short, especially when trying to create line segments perpendicular to the chart line.

## Solution
Flutter's pixel-perfect control came to the rescue. With solid documentation from the fl_chart developers and a bit of AI assistance, I crafted a custom FlDotPainter called FlDotLineSegmentPainter and used the custom paint method for the text labels.

Here's the code gist for the custom painter:

```dart
// Custom FlDotPainter code snippet here
```

## Demo
For demonstration purposes, here's a placeholder for the component I created with the custom FlDotPainter. 

<object type="text/html" data="/pink.html" width="150" height="150"></object>

<object type="text/html" data="/embedded/embedded_fl_dot_line_segment_painter/build/web/index.html" width="1500" height="1500"></object>

This technique was inspired by a recent Flutter Forward talk by Tim Sneath. [Watch the demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKQYGKAe5W8&t=5799s).

## Conclusion
The result was a custom FlDotPainter that perfectly matched the provided image, and the prototype received positive feedback from the team. This experience reaffirmed the ease of extending Flutter's capabilities. I've also submitted a pull request to the fl_chart package, so this painter might be included in a future release.
